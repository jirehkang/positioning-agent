# Positioning Agent (WIP)

Positioning Agent is a work-in-progress tool designed to assist Product Marketing Managers, Product Specialists, and founders or teams without dedicated product marketers in crafting clear and effective product positioning statements.

## Purpose

The app helps users think through the foundational components of strong positioning by guiding them through five key areas:

1. **Product Description**
2. **Category Overview**
3. **Competitor Landscape**
4. **Target Persona**
5. **Unique Differentiators**

Once these inputs are confirmed, the tool synthesizes the insights to generate a well-informed positioning statement.

The approach draws inspiration from the Product Marketing Allianceâ€™s article [Your Guide to Positioning](https://www.productmarketingalliance.com/your-guide-to-positioning/)!

## Why This Exists

Not everyone has access to a product marketing team but everyone can benefit from structured product thinking. This tool lowers the barrier by breaking down the positioning process into actionable, bite-sized steps.

## Status

This project is under active development. I plan to deploy the app soon after refining the output, enhancing the UI, and improving other key details.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenAI SDK
