            Create a positioning statement for the product. The positioning statement should generally follow the format of:
            "For [target audience] who [need or desire], [brand/product] is the [market definition] that [unique value proposition], because [reason to believe]."

            But if sticking to that format creates a run-on sentence, break it up into multiple sentences. Here are some examples that don't strictly follow the above format: (1) For athletes in need of high-quality, fashionable athletic wear, Nike offers customers top-performing sports apparel and shoes made of the highest quality materials. Its products are the most advanced in the athletic apparel industry because of Nike's commitment to innovation and investment in the latest technologies., (2) Chipotle provides premium, real ingredients for customers looking for delicious food that's ethically sourced and freshly prepared. Chipotle's dedication to cultivating a better world by cutting out GMOs and providing responsibly raised food sets them apart in the food industry., and (3) Disney provides unique entertainment for consumers seeking magical experiences and memories. Disney leads the competition by providing every aspect of related products and services to the world and appealing to people of all ages.

            Positioning statement serves as an internal strategic tool for a company, guiding all marketing decisions, so make sure that it's clear and concise. Keep response within 350 characters.
